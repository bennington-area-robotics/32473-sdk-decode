# Team 32473 FTC-SDK

This is **Team 32473's fork** of the official [FtcRobotController](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController) SDK.

## For Team Members

### Where to Put Your Code
All team robot code goes in the `TeamCode` module:
```
TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/
```

### Getting Started
1. Clone this repo (not the official base FtcRobotController)
2. Open the project in Android Studio Ladybug (2024.2) or later
3. Connect your Control Hub or phone via USB
4. Build and deploy to the robot

### When to Use This vs OnBot Java and Blocks
- **Use this repo in Android Studio et al.** when you want all the niceties of a real IDE: linting, version control, code completion, and the ability to use external dependencies.
- **Use OnBot Java** for the ability to make quick edits directly on the robot without requiring any setup or long waits to deploy.
- **Use Blocks** for the zero build time deployments, easy and intuitive editing, and a lower barrier-to-entry for learning.

## FTC SDK Documentation

### Requirements
To use this project with Android Studio, you will need Android Studio Ladybug (2024.2) or later.

### Learning Resources
If you are new to robotics or new to the *FIRST* Tech Challenge, start with the [FTC Blocks Tutorial](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/programming_resources/blocks/Blocks-Tutorial.html) to get familiar with the control system.

Even if you have relatively advanced knowledge of Java itself, it is usually helpful to start with [FTC Blocks](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/programming_resources/blocks/Blocks-Tutorial.html) to become familiar with the basics of programming FTC robots, then migrate to [OnBot Java](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/programming_resources/onbot_java/OnBot-Java-Tutorial.html), [Android Studio](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/programming_resources/android_studio_java/Android-Studio-Tutorial.html), or another IDE afterwards.

### Getting Help
- [FIRST Tech Challenge Documentation](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/index.html) - Official tutorials and guides
- [FTC Javadoc Documentation](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.firstinspires.ftc) - API reference
- [FIRST Tech Challenge Community](https://ftc-community.firstinspires.org/) - Online forum for technical questions

### Sample OpModes
This project contains a large selection of Sample OpModes (robot code examples) under [/FtcRobotController/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotcontroller/external/samples](FtcRobotController/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotcontroller/external/samples) which can be copied into your /teamcode module to be used as-is, or modified to suit your team's needs.
